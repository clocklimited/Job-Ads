## Placements love Clock

This will be the 14th year that we have taken on placements students, with many coming back and working with us after University. You will work closely with the current placement students when you first start to be shown the ropes and it will be your job to do the same the following year.

*"It's a great feeling waking up in the morning and not being bitter about another day at work! Working at Clock has bridged the once impenetrable gap between enjoyment, education, and working in an office. The people there have become some of my closest friends. And it's such a great feeling to work in a team that together produce incredible work, that everyone is proud of. I return to uni, and 'turning over a new leaf' seems to barely come close to my attitude of finishing my degree. Sitting on a plethora of professional skills, I eagerly wait for an excuse to use them."*
